hello alexon team 

in this task i used a api that support add , update , delete , toggle but not support any filters or search but i add the logic of all of this to app

i take 10h to build this app which support two design system light and dark and support more that 6 variable colors and also support translation from ar to en

if any bug appeared with you i hope this not affect on my skills ..... i need only from u to look at my code and arch that i build it 


important Notes : -

filter and search is not founded in back end but i add this logic to code and it working very well
 
login conditionals : admin as userName || 123456 as Password
